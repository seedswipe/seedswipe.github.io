bip 32 seed swipe
---

Built as a weekend hobby project.

Using mostly libraries developed around Trezor Web wallet.

It should be "seed sweep" but I confused "swipe" and "sweep" and now I am too lazy to rename it.

It runs at https://seedswipe.github.io/

Using:
* https://github.com/trezor/blockbook for backend (instance at https://karelchain.com )
* https://github.com/karel-3d/bitcoinjs-lib (fork of https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib )
* https://github.com/trezor/hd-wallet (that we use in web wallet)
* https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39
